# Contributing to the wps-pipeline-notebook

Please feel free to contribute to the wps-pipeline-notebook.
You can fork it and adopt it as you need (for example to call other web services).

## Version schema
We use a version schema that is just date oriented.

## Branching policy
We use a development branch for every feature that we add.
Master branch should just be used for
a) the initial version
b) the place to merge feature branches into.

## Development
We change the code in this repository as we go to test new services in our
wps pipeline for the RIESGOS project (http://www.riesgos.de/en/).
